    <h3>Easy macaroni and cheese, this boxed classic has been spruced up in this recipe.</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>6 ounces (170g) elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>6 ounces (180ml)<em> evaporated milk</em></li>
        <li>6 ounces (170g) grated mild or medium cheddar cheese, or<br>
            any good melting cheese, such as Fontina, Gruy√®re, or Jack.
        </li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place macaroni in a medium saucepan or skillet and add just enough cold water<br>
             to cover. Add a pinch of salt and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring<br>
             frequently. Continue to cook, stirring, until water has been almost completely<br>
            absorbed and macaroni is just shy of al dente, about 6 minutes.

        <li>Immediately add evaporated milk and bring to a boil. Add cheese. Reduce heat <br>
            to low and cook, stirring continuously, until cheese is melted and liquid has reduced<br>
            to a creamy sauce, about 2 minutes longer. Season to taste with more salt and serve immediately.
